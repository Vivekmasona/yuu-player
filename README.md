# [Yuu Player](https://yuu.pages.dev/)
A YouTube playlist player made with React and Tailwind

## Important features
- True shuffle
  - YouTube and YouTube Music only shuffle playlists in a range of Â±200 from the current video
- No ads
- Autoplay
  - Auto-skips unavailable videos but doesn't hide them
- Saves playlist queues
- Plays audio when phone's screen is off
  - Chrome on iOS
  - Firefox + desktop mode on Android

## Future features (Todo)
- Fix importing to not rely on polling
- Combine "import" and "update" options
- Improve queue-rendering speed (currently only shows top 70 videos to avoid lag)

## Known bugs
- If you manually end a video while it is loading, the player may begin repeatedly skipping videos
  - This has something to do with the feature that skips unavailable videos, but I'm not sure how to fix it.

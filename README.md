# [Yuu Player](https://yuu.pages.dev/)
A YouTube playlist player made with React and Tailwind

## Important features
- True shuffle
  - YouTube and YouTube Music only shuffle playlists in a range of Â±200 from the current video
- No ads
- Autoplay
  - Auto-skips unavailable videos but doesn't hide them
- Saves playlist queues
- Plays audio when phone's screen is off (requires Firefox + desktop mode (unsure if this works on iOS))

## Future features (Todo)
- Make usage more intuitive and streamlined for new users
  - Combine "import" and "update" options
- Improve queue-rendering speed (currently only shows top 70 videos to avoid lag)
